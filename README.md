# t-SNE-From-Scratch
Python code for the implementation of t-SNE algorithm from scratch. 

t-SNE is one of the best dimensionality reduction algorithms that is frequently used in data science projects for data visualization purposes. It uses manifold learning to reduce the dimension of data. We used this algorithms to visualize the MNIST dataset, which contains 10000 images of size 28*28(784 when flattened). Moreover, we compared the t-SNE with the PCA on this dataset, and the result shows that the MNIST dataset is highly non-linear and linear dimensionality algorithms such as PCA can't perform well on this dataset.

The final 2d plot produced by the t-SNE algorithm is presented below.
