# t-SNE-From-Scratch
Python code for the implementation of t-SNE algorithm from scratch. 

t-SNE is one of the best dimensionality reduction algorithms that is frequently used in data science projects for data visualization purposes. It uses manifold learning to reduce the dimension of data. We used this algorithms to visualize the MNIST dataset, which contains 10000 images of size 28*28(784 when flattened). The final 2d plot is presented below.
